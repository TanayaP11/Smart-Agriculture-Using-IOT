# Smart-Agriculture-Using-IOT
To proposed IoT based Smart Farming System which will enable farmers to have data of soil moisture environment temperature at very low cost. “SAVE THE AGRICULTURE”, main factor of agriculture is to predict the climatic changes, here we are using IoT for monitoring the weather as well as atmospheric changes throughout the crop field by having several systems in different fields as clients, which is getting reported every time to the server, about the current atmospheric change at that every certain place. So that watering and pesticides can be served based on the conditions of the field.
Using some sensor like Temperature sensor ,humidity sensor ,photodiode sensor for sunlight ,buzzers for alert ,gas sensor for green gas ,rain sensor ,soil sensor for moisture,ultrasonic sensors ,servo motor for sprinkling purpose ,PIR sensor for detecting objects such as animal ,human beings ,so that it will protect them from emitting gases by blowing buzzers. By using sensor values, calculate the data. Internet of Things has a strong backbone of various technologies such as Sensor Networks, Security Protocols to made Agricultural things simpler.
